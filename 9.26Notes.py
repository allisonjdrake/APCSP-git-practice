#Binary Search: time = O(logn) basically meaning that as you add more values, the time increases 
    #logarithmically (slower than linear)
    #list must be sorted
    #goes through the list cutting it in half asking "is value greater than this point or less than"
    #only has to evaluate half of the set of data

#Linear Search: time = O(n) basically meaning that as you add values, time increases linearly
    #goes through each value asking "is this the one"
