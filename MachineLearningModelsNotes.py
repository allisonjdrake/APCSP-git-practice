# Unsupervised:
#     Clustered - good for text data
#         ex: set of tweets, want to figure out something about those tweets
#         ex: tiktok algorithm
#      Term Frequency: frequency of a term in a document (indicates how often a word occurs)
#      Inverse Document Frequency: mportant ofa term (highlights low and rare common terms)
#      TF-IDF: combines both
# Supervised:
#     Decision Tree:(best decision for me) tracks one variable to another to the output
#         good for categorical data
#     Random Forest: Multiple decision trees
#     Linear Regression: Correlating independent and dependent
#         usually best for things that have a variety of values (not categorical)
#     Supervised Clustering: hey, here's what is right (has an "answer key")
#         usually good for text
